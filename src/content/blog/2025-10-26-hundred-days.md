A hundred days ago, I left management.

That wasn't how it felt at the time; I'd just been made redundant after several years in leadership.

But when the dust settled, I realised this was something I'd been quietly wanting for a while: a return to building things myself.

## Scale-up habits die hard

Years in fintech and management shape you in subtle ways. You start to think exclusively in terms of frameworks, alignment, and stakeholders. Every task becomes a project, every project needs a doc, and every decision requires a meeting.

Some of that's necessary in large, regulated environments. It keeps things consistent. Predictable.

But when you return to a more focused, specialised engineering organisation, you see how much of that is just inertia. How often we mistake coordination for progress.

Here, we talk, we decide, we build - simple, streamlined, responsive - and I'd forgotten how refreshing that can be.

## Relearning the craft

Coming back to hands-on engineering after years in leadership has been humbling. I was, and am, rusty. I reach for patterns that don't quite fit anymore. I look up syntax I once knew instinctively.

But I'm also sharper in other ways. Years of reviewing architecture and mentoring engineers have rewired how I think about design and clarity. The output might be slower, but the intent is stronger.

And the best part is the camaraderie. I bring context; my teammates bring modern fluency and technical depth. Together, we meet in the middle. They make me faster; I help them zoom out. It's a better loop than I expected.

## Ego and perspective

Stepping down from "Head of Engineering" to "Staff Engineer" looks like a demotion on paper. And yes, it messes with your identity for a bit.

There's a part of you that misses being in every conversation, influencing strategy, managing people.

But then you start delivering again - and you realise how much lighter it feels to just do the work.

I'm not delegating problems anymore. I'm solving them. My code runs. The metrics improve. The feedback is instant.

And I still get to mentor, guide, and shape decisions - just without the meetings, frameworks, and dotted lines.

## Rediscovering impact

One thing I've learned at Approov is that focus is its own kind of scale.

You can be lean and still serious. You can be efficient and still ambitious.

You can do meaningful work without fifty people in the room.

When something breaks, you fix it. When something works, you build on it.

There's no hiding behind process - and that's energising.

## The pendulum swings

Charity Majors has discussed the [Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) for many years. As sage as her wisdom is, it's often hard to relate until you've lived it.

This experience has proven to me that careers aren't linear. They oscillate.

You move toward leadership for influence. You move back to individual contribution for clarity.

You move toward management to hone your people skills. You move back to coding to stay sharp.

Both are valid. Both matter.

To my friends who were made redundant from leadership roles this year: I know that shift can feel like failure. But it isn't. It's a recalibration.

You're not going backwards. You're rediscovering what brought you here.

A hundred days in, I can say it plainly: I should have done this sooner.
